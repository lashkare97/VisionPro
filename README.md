# VisionPro

This project is a simple alternative to the project I uploaded **Fingerprint scanner VAE** which provides results efficiently. It involves preprocessing, applying edge filters, generating composite images, extracting SIFT features, and matching test samples using feature similarity.

---

## Project Highlights

- Converts `.bmp` files to `.jpg`
- Resizes images to a standard resolution
- Applies **Sobel**, **Canny**, and **Laplacian** edge filters
- Generates composite images by merging filtered outputs
- Extracts **SIFT features** for each image
- Performs **FLANN-based feature matching** with a test image
- Saves image metadata in CSV
- Visualizes and saves keypoints for inspection

##  How to Use

### 1. Organize Your Dataset

- Place your `.bmp` images in `bmp_images/`
- Ensure your test image is named `test.jpg` and located in `test_images/`

### 2. Update Folder Paths

Edit the top of `VisionPro.py` to match your folder names:

```python
input_folder = 'bmp_images'
output_folder = 'jpg_images'
path3 = 'resized_images'
Sobel = 'sobel_images'
Canny = 'canny_images'
Laplacian = 'laplacian_images'
Composite = 'composite_images'
Test = 'test_images'
csv_file = 'image_dimensions.csv'
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pillow
```

---

### 4. Run the Pipeline

```bash
python LIFT_Pipeline_Cleaned.py
```

---

## 🔍 Output & Logs

- Transformed images saved in their respective folders
- Composite images represent the maximum value from edge filters
- Images with SIFT keypoints are saved with `kp_` prefix
- Best matching image for the test sample is printed in the terminal
- Runtime performance is displayed after completion

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- **OpenCV** for image processing and filters
- **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)** for feature detection
- **FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors)** for matching
- **NumPy** and **PIL** for matrix operations and metadata

---

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure your test image exists and is correctly named
- You can visualize matches by extending the code to draw `cv2.drawMatches()`
- Composite merging uses `np.maximum()` for feature enhancement
